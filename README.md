This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications: accessing data from asynchronous operations before the data has fully loaded. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, which attempts to access document data before the `getDoc()` promise resolves. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that uses `.then()` to handle the promise and access the data only after it's loaded.
